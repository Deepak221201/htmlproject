        <h3>Full Stack Development Using Java</h3>
        <p>A Full Stack Java course typically covers both front-end and back-end development using Java technologies. Here's a brief overview of what such a course might include:</p>

<p>Core Java: The course would start with the fundamentals of Java programming language, covering topics such as syntax, data types, control flow, object-oriented programming concepts (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.), exception handling, and file I/O.</p>

<p>Java EE (Enterprise Edition): The course would delve into Java EE technologies for back-end development. This includes Servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), Java Persistence API (JPA) for database access using frameworks like Hibernate, and JavaServer Faces (JSF) for building web applications.</p>

<p>Spring Framework: Spring is a widely used framework for building Java applications. The course might cover Spring Core, Spring MVC for building web applications, Spring Boot for rapid application development, Spring Data for database access, and Spring Security for authentication and authorization.</p>

<p>Front-end Development: The course may include front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end frameworks/libraries like Angular or React for building interactive user interfaces.</p>

<p>Database Management: The course would cover database concepts and SQL for data manipulation and retrieval. It may also include database management systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle, and integrating them with Java applications using JDBC or ORM frameworks like Hibernate.</p>

<p>RESTful Web Services: The course might cover building RESTful web services using frameworks like Spring REST or JAX-RS, and consuming these services from front-end applications.</p>
