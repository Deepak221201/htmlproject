        <h3>Data Visualization Techniques</h3>
        <p>Data visualization techniques are methods used to represent data graphically. They aim to provide insights, identify patterns, trends, correlations, and outliers in the data. Here are some common data visualization techniques:</p>

<p>Bar Charts: Bar charts represent data using rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the values they represent. They are suitable for comparing discrete categories.</p>

<p>Line Charts: Line charts display data points connected by lines. They are often used to show trends over time or continuous data.</p>

<p>Pie Charts: Pie charts divide data into segments of a circle, with each segment representing a proportion of the whole. They are useful for showing the composition of a whole.</p>

<p>Scatter Plots: Scatter plots display individual data points as dots in two-dimensional space. They are useful for visualizing relationships between two variables.</p>

<p>Histograms: Histograms represent the distribution of a continuous variable by dividing the data into bins and displaying the frequency of each bin as a bar.</p>

<p>Heatmaps: Heatmaps represent data in a matrix format, with colors indicating the magnitude of values. They are often used to visualize correlations or densities in large datasets.</p>

<p>Bubble Charts: Bubble charts are similar to scatter plots but include an additional dimension represented by the size of the markers. They are useful for visualizing three-dimensional data.</p>

<p>Treemaps: Treemaps display hierarchical data as nested rectangles, with each level of the hierarchy represented by a different color or size.</p>

<p>Box Plots: Box plots summarize the distribution of a continuous variable by displaying the median, quartiles, and outliers.</p>

<p>Network Graphs: Network graphs represent relationships between entities as nodes and edges. They are useful for visualizing complex networks, such as social networks or biological networks.</p>
