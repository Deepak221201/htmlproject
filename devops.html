        <h3>Continuous Delivery And Devops</h3>
        <p>Continuous Delivery (CD) and DevOps are closely related concepts in software development, aimed at improving the efficiency, quality, and speed of software delivery.</p>

<p>Continuous Delivery (CD):
Continuous Delivery is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time. The key principles of Continuous Delivery include automation of the software delivery process, building a deployment pipeline, and ensuring that the software is always in a releasable state. CD enables teams to deliver software quickly, efficiently, and with high quality.</p>

<p>DevOps:
DevOps is a cultural and organizational movement that emphasizes collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. DevOps aims to break down silos between these teams, enabling faster delivery of software and greater reliability in operations. DevOps practices include automation of processes, continuous integration and delivery, infrastructure as code, and monitoring and feedback loops..</p>
